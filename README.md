# classification-project
The first homework for the ANN2DL course focuses on classifying blood cell images into 8 categories using CNNs and advanced techniques such as Transfer Learning and fine-tuning. The best-performing fine-tuned model was EfficientNetV2S, which, combined with data augmentation and a learning rate scheduler, proved to be the most effective approach. Additional experiments and project details can be found in the attached report and notebooks.
